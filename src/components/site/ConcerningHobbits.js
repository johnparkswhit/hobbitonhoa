                <h1>Concerning Hobbits</h1>
                <br/>
                <p>
                Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous 
                formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled 
                earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. 
                They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a 
                forge -bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with 
                tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as 
                they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to 
                find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined 
                to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and 
                deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of 
                disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to 
                meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may 
                seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, 
                and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity 
                and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered 
                inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.

                For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout and 
                stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height 
                is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom 
                now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days 
                they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), 
                son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He 
                was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old.

                As for the Hobbits of the Shire,  
                in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They 
                dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they 
                seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad 
                in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was 
                commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was 
                shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other 
                useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather 
                than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to 
                laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and 
                drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of 
                six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and 
                delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and 
                eagerly accepted.
